This is a basic recipe website, it's the first project of "the odin project" fundamentals, this README.md was created using the CLI of xubuntu and modified using the build in text editor nano. Everything else was created usig the CLI and edited in VS code.

Also I tried to follow the steps in https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ on how to write a good commit message :)
