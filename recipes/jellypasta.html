    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>Jello gelatin mix – Whatever flavor you want.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but
        firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the powdered gelatin into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add boiling
        water to the gelatin mix, and stir for 2 minutes until it's completely
        dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold macaroni into the gelatin mix while it's hot, add cold water and
        refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the gelatin is firm and
        doesn't stick to your fingers when touched.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomato sauce when you take it out of the refrigerator and it's done.
      </li>
